# How to get OAE running with docker

## Run built image from dockerhub

```bash
docker run --rm -it -P --network host --name=oae oaeproject/oae-demo:latest
```

You'll still need to set up the dns entries, as follows:

```bash
# As root or with sudo
echo "127.0.0.1 admin.oae.com" > /etc/hosts
echo "127.0.0.1 guest.oae.com" > /etc/hosts
```

As soon as the container boot, you may go to `admin.oae.com` (admin interface) or `guest.oae.com` (test tenant).

## Build and run locally

```bash
# Build the image
docker build --rm -t oae-demo:latest -f Dockerfile .
# Run the container (all servers)
docker run --rm -it -P --network host --name=oae oae-demo:latest
```

This is intended to work on linux alone.

## Debug locally

There's only so much debugging you can do being `node`, which is the last set user in the Dockerfile. If you need to debug the image, remove that line and build it locally, you'll be `root` and have all the access you need.
